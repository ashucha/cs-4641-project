            Though COVID-19 vaccine has proven its efficiency, many still remain hesitant due to potential side effects.
            Side
            effects include the majority reporting mild to moderate symptoms, such as fever and fatigue, but these
            symptoms
            generally would not cause long-term conditions, though rare cases of severe symptoms or potential death are
            possible. We will use machine learning to build a model that helps people make a decision of whether to take
            the
            vaccine or not by predicting possible outcomes/syndromes of a person taking the vaccine given indicating
            factors,
            such as age and gender.

            Problem Definition
        </h1>
        <p>
            There are a couple of reasons why we want to tackle the challenge of vaccine hesitancy through this project.
            The
            first is that a large enough portion of the population is hesitant to get the vaccine because herd immunity
            is far
            from achievable at the current level. Specifically, only about 83% of Americans have received at least one
            dose
            while only 71% is fully vaccinated. According to the Mayo Clinic, “94% of the population must be immune to
            interrupt the chain of transmission” of COVID-19, a highly optimistic goal at this rate. The second reason
            why we
            chose this issue is due to new developments in COVID-19 and the fight against it. This includes the fact
            that the
            FDA is looking into authorizing the vaccine for children under the age of 5, a fourth dose expected to be
            available soon, and COVID cases recently rising. These developments give lots of opportunities for
            misinformation
            to expand beyond what has already been spread.

            Method
        </h1>
        <p>
            Our problem is a classification problem and thus, we used classification models to try and solve it. We have
            decided to use K-means, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and
            Multi-Layer Perceptron as our algorithms. These models were implement using the <code>scikit-learn</code>
            Python library.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, K-means is most helpful when our data is somewhat well-separated into two main clusters
            (recovered or not recovered from COVID vaccine complications), in which case it will use hard classification
            to categorize datapoints based on cluster centers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that works similarly to a dichotomous key,
            where there are decision nodes and leaf nodes. Each decision node represents a division of the data into
            parts by some rule that the algorithm decides based on the inputs and expected values of the data. Each leaf
            node represents an outcome of that decision, which is then fed to the next decision node. If there is no
            decision node, then that leaf node is the final output of the algorithm. This method will be used to
            classify our inputs into recovered or non-recovered individuals. The decisions to split the inputs (ex.: "Is
            the age above 65?") are the decision nodes while the outcomes are the leaf nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A surface-level definition of the Random Forest Classifier is that it is a collection of Decision Trees. It
            essentially compiles the results of multiple Decision Trees and outputs those results into one final output.
            This can be done either through outputting the result that the majority of the Decision Trees outputted or
            taking the average of those outputs. The former is mainly used for classification and will be used for our
            use case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Logistic Regression is a type of Discriminative supervised learning used for classification problems. It
            uses a sigmoid function, which in turn uses a linear combination of inputs and features, to output a
            soft-classification (probability) of the classification of inputs. In our case, we can use logistic
            regression to output the probability that an input is in a certain class by setting a threshold value (0.5)
            to put it into one of our two classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network which uses layers of neurons, each
            with activation functions, to find patterns in data and create decision boundaries to classify inputs. For
            instance, to make a square boundary, one layer with four neurons may make each neuron take one side of the
            square (up, down, left, right) as lines and compile them together to make a layer which outputs whether a
            data point is inside the boundary. These layers are called hidden layers and form a network which can
            generate complex decision boundaries (or functions in the case of regression) that simple and ordinary
            methods such as K-means and logistic regression may not be able to find due to their limited scope and
            applications. In our case especially, given the nature of the features that we input (both continuous and
            discrete types), a decision boundary may turn out to be too complex or even impossible for other
            classification algorithms to come up with.

            Data

        <p>
            We have decided to use the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) dataset compiled by the Department
            of Health and Human Services. It consists of over 34,000 reported incidents of adverse reactions to various
            vaccines, among them the COVID-19 vaccine. A major problem with this dataset, however, is that its
            formatting is inconsistent as data is frequently missing from some cells or structure of data across rows
            and columns varies from cell to cell. For example, symptom and allergy reporting does not have a consistent
            delimeter, and these may be important features in predicting someone's risk of death or other adverse
            effects from taking the COVID vaccine. This is likely due to the fact the dataset is a compliation of
            adverse event reporting from people across the United States and consistency would be very hard to achieve
            among such a large population. To better feed the data into our model, we dropped unnecessary columns and
            rows which had missing data, but by the end of it, we could only use the column stating whether someone had
            recovered or not as the column which stated whether someone had died was reduced to two entries by the end
            of our data cleaning. Unfortunately, this is the best dataset that we have at our disposal so we still
            decided to use it for our project. On the bright side, it is quite a detailed list which we can work with in
            the future to try and work with better or fill in using Naive Bayes or other semi-supervised learning.
