    <p>
      Though COVID-19 vaccine has proven its efficiency, many still remain hesitant due to potential side effects. Side
      effects include the majority reporting mild to moderate symptoms, such as fever and fatigue, but these symptoms
      generally would not cause long-term conditions, though rare cases of severe symptoms or potential death are
      possible. We will use machine learning to build a model that helps people make a decision of whether to take the
      vaccine or not by predicting possible outcomes/syndromes of a person taking the vaccine given indicating factors,
      such as age and gender.

      Problem Definition
    </h1>
    <p>
      There are a couple of reasons why we want to tackle the challenge of vaccine hesitancy through this project. The
      first is that a large enough portion of the population is hesitant to get the vaccine because herd immunity is far
      from achievable at the current level. Specifically, only about 83% of Americans have received at least one dose
      while only 71% is fully vaccinated. According to the Mayo Clinic, “94% of the population must be immune to
      interrupt the chain of transmission” of COVID-19, a highly optimistic goal at this rate. The second reason why we
      chose this issue is due to new developments in COVID-19 and the fight against it. This includes the fact that the
      FDA is looking into authorizing the vaccine for children under the age of 5, a fourth dose expected to be
      available soon, and COVID cases recently rising. These developments give lots of opportunities for misinformation
      to expand beyond what has already been spread.

      Method
    </h1>
    <p>
      The potential methods that we may use include K-means clustering or hierarchical clusterings based on the number
      of data and the number of factors of data. According to the data we have already got, the factors include age,
      sex, weight and so on. Since the factors are all discrete variables, thus classification may be another method
      that we will consider.

  <section class="container" id="data">
    <h1 class="display-1">
      Data
    </h1>
    <p>
      We have already found some data online that we would analyze. The one dataset is from the FDA (US Food and Drug
      Administration) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and the other one is from New York Times. We
      will try to get more official and more reliable data from more official websites. There are two datasets that we
      have downloaded so far: worldwide percentage of population vaccinated and worldwide adverse reactions after
      vaccination. By using clustering methods, we will take deeper analysis on dividing them into several groups based
      on the factors of ages, gender, symptoms after vaccination, times for vaccination, and etc.

      Potential Results and Discussion
    </h1>
    <p>
      We currently plan to use the adjusted_rand_score metric from sklearn to evaluate our clustering performance. This
      metric compares the predicted clusters with a defined ground truth to output the accuracy. Additionally, we expect
      to find that patient demographics do correlate with the severity of vaccine-related side effects. At this moment,
      we don't know which specific features will correlate better with the side effects, but that is the reason we are
      undertaking this project.
